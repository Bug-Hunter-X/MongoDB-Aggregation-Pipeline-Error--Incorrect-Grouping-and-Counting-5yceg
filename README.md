# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB aggregation pipelines: incorrect grouping and counting. The provided code shows an aggregation pipeline that produces inaccurate results due to a flawed $group stage.

## Bug Description
The aggregation pipeline aims to group documents by a specific field and count the occurrences of each group. However, the $group stage is implemented incorrectly, leading to inaccurate counts.  The issue is detailed in the `bug.js` file.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the aggregation pipeline.  This corrected version accurately groups and counts documents, providing the expected results.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` to see the erroneous results.
3. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected output.

This example highlights the importance of carefully constructing MongoDB aggregation pipelines to avoid unexpected results and ensure data accuracy.
